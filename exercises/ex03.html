    <p class="special">“At first, she’d counted the time in between surges to calculate their frequency. Second by
        second. Ten thousand, eight hundred. Every three hours without fail. Always the same. Then she’d counted the
        surges, but as the number grew and grew, she stopped, afraid to know.”</p>

            <p>Helena wondered sometimes if she still had eyes. The darkness surrounding her never ended. She thought at
                first if she waited long enough, some glimmer of light would appear, or someone would come. Yet no
                matter how long she waited, there was nothing.</p>

                She had a body; she could feel it wrapped around her like a cage, but no amount of effort or
                determination could make it move. It floated inert and unresponsive except when jerking violently as the
                surges hit—jolts of electricity tearing through her, beginning at the base of her neck and making every
                muscle in her body seize violently. As suddenly as they came, they’d be gone. They were her only sense
                of time.

                remembered that detail. Remembered that she’d been placed there as a prisoner, kept preserved, but
                someday, someone would come for her.”
